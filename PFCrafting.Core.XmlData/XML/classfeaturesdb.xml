The arcanist must select one school of magic and one sorcerer bloodline. Once selected, these choices cannot be changed. Whenever the arcanist casts a spell of her chosen school, using one of her arcanist spell slots, she can expend one use of her blood focus as a free action to bolster the spell. This adds 1 to the spell’s caster level and DC. The arcanist cannot expend more than one use of blood focus on a given casting of a spell. In addition, as a standard action an arcanist can expend one use of blood focus to use a bloodline power from her bloodline. She can use any one bloodline power that she would have access to, treating her arcanist levels as sorcerer levels. (The only except is that she cannot use the bloodline power granted at 20th level.) If the bloodline power is limited in its uses per day, she cannot use blood focus to use that bloodline power more times per day than she could if she were a sorcerer of the same level. If the bloodline power grants a permanent bonus (such as fire resistance or the ability to f ly), the arcanist gains this ability for a number of rounds equal to her arcanist level. The arcanist substitutes her Intelligence modifier for her Charisma modifier when determining any variables in these bloodline powers. The arcanist can use blood focus a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. If she expends all of her daily uses of this ability, she is fatigued.

At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in other wizards’ spellbooks to her own (see Chapter 9 of the Core Rulebook).

To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the arcanist’s Intelligence modifier. An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1–3 in the Core Rulebook). An arcanist’s may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1–2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster affect the number of spells the arcanist can prepare. An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare. Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply a metamagic feat to a prepared spell as she casts it, increasing the casting time as normal. Like a wizard, she may prepare a spell with a metamagic feat, casting it using the normal casting time. She may combine these options, preparing a spell with a metamagic feat, then add another metamagic feat when she casts it by increasing the casting time." Class="Arcanist"  />

To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing it ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager’s Charisma modifier. A bloodrager’s highest level of spells is 4th. Magus spells of 5th level and above are not on the bloodrager class spell list, and a bloodrager cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of magus spells of 5th level or higher. Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 17, Table 1–3). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast them at any point during a bloodrage (as per his blood casting ability), assuming he hasn’t yet used up his spells per day for that level. The bloodrager’s selection of spells is limited. a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of the bloodrager’s choice at 4th level. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1–4.

A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard’s bardic performance special ability for any effect that limits bardic performances, such as how many can be maintained at once. A raging song is language-dependent with audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs. When the raging song begins, each ally within range must decide whether to accept or refuse the effects of the raging song (this is not an action); unconscious allies automatically accept the song. Once this choice is made, it lasts until the song ends or the ally moves out of range (returning to the area allows the ally to decide again); the raging allies cannot decide to end the rage on their own. Allies with 30 feet gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, but also take a –1 penalty to AC.

Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual power more than once. When using raging song, the skald chooses which rage power to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of that rage power. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers which require a minimum barbarian level. If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per rage (such as no escape), each ally affected by the raging song can use the rage power once during the raging song. If the skald has a rage power from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during a raging song. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.
