To use this deed, a swashbuckler cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield other than a buckler. A precise strike only works against living creatures with discernible anatomies. The extra damage of precise strike is precision damage, and isn’t multiplied with a critical hit. As a swift action, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to double her precise strike's damage bonus on the next attack. This must be used before the end of her turn, or it is lost."
